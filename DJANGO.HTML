    <h1>DJANGO</h1>
    <img src="./django logo.png" alt="image not found" height="200px" width="200px">
    <P>Django is a high-level, open-source web framework written in Python. It follows the Model-View-Template (MVT) architecture and is known for its "batteries-included" philosophy, meaning it comes with many built-in features like user authentication, admin panel, ORM (Object-Relational Mapping), and form handling. Django promotes rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It takes care of much of the hassle of web development, allowing developers to focus on writing their apps without reinventing the wheel. It is widely used for building secure, scalable, and maintainable web applications like content management systems, social networks, and data-driven apps.</P>
