    <p>Bootstrap is a popular front-end framework based on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides pre-designed components like buttons, navigation bars, modals, carousels, and forms that help developers build responsive and mobile-friendly websites quickly and efficiently. Bootstrap uses a grid system for layout and comes with built-in classes that simplify styling and alignment. It also includes JavaScript-based components powered by libraries like jQuery. With Bootstrap, you can achieve professional-looking designs without writing much custom CSS or JavaScript, making it ideal for rapid development.
