    <p>Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript on the server side (outside the browser). It is built on the V8 JavaScript engine (the same used in Google Chrome), which makes it very fast. Node.js is event-driven and non-blocking, meaning it can handle many connections at once, making it ideal for real-time applications like chat apps, online games, and streaming platforms. It is commonly used with Express.js, a lightweight web framework, to build RESTful APIs and web servers. Node.js is popular among full-stack developers because it enables using JavaScript for both frontend and backend development.</p>
