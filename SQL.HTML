    <h1>STRUCTURED QUERY LANGUAGE</h1>

    <p>SQL is both a language used to interact with relational databases and a category of databases (like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQL Server). SQL databases store data in tables with rows and columns, where each row represents a record and each column represents a field (or attribute). SQL is used to query, insert, update, and delete data using structured commands like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE. These databases follow a schema-based approach, meaning the structure of the data (columns, types, relationships) must be defined beforehand. SQL databases are ideal for applications where data integrity, relationships (foreign keys), and complex queries are important â€” such as banking systems, e-commerce websites, and ERP applications.
