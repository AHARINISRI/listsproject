    <h1>SPRING</h1>
    <img src="/spring.png" alt="">
    <p>Spring is a comprehensive, enterprise-level framework for building robust Java applications. The most popular module, Spring Boot, simplifies the setup and development of Spring applications by auto-configuring components and reducing boilerplate code. It follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern and supports features like dependency injection, transaction management, and security. Spring is widely used for developing scalable and secure enterprise applications, microservices, and APIs. It integrates well with databases, messaging systems, and cloud services, and is backed by a strong community and corporate support.
