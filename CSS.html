    <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and design the content created with HTML. It controls the visual presentation of a webpage, including layout, colors, fonts, spacing, and responsiveness. CSS allows developers to create visually appealing websites that look good on all screen sizes. It can be written inline, internally within HTML, or externally in separate files. CSS also supports animations and transitions, adding smooth visual effects to elements.</p>
