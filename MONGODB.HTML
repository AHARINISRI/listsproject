    <p>MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format called documents. Instead of tables and rows, it uses collections and documents. Each document is a set of key-value pairs, and documents within the same collection can have different structures. MongoDB is schema-less, which means it allows you to store different fields and types of data without a strict predefined structure. It is highly scalable and performs well with large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data. MongoDB is commonly used in applications that need high performance, flexibility, and quick development, such as real-time analytics, content management systems, and IoT applications.
